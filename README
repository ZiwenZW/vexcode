# VEX PROS Control Utilities

This project provides a set of utility classes and control functions for VEX V5 robots using PROS.  
It includes **filters**, **control curves**, and an **arcade drive** implementation for precise and smooth robot control.

## Features

### 1. Filters
- **Dead Zone Filter (`deadZoneFilter`)**
  - Eliminates small joystick noise.
  - Can limit maximum and minimum input.
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    deadZoneFilter dz(95, 5); // max=95, min=5
    double filtered_input = dz.apply(joystick_value);
    ```

- **Template-based filter system**
  - Flexible for other numeric types.
  - Easily extendable for low-pass, slew-rate, or Kalman filters.

### 2. Control Curves
- **Linear control (`linearControl`)**
  - Identity mapping for joystick input.
  - Can be extended for exponential, cubic, or other custom curves.

- **Template-based control system**
  - Supports compile-time optimization.
  - Can chain multiple filters and control modes for advanced driver assistance.

### 3. Arcade Drive (`arcadeDrive`)  
- Combines **forward/backward** and **turning** joystick axes.
- Automatically normalizes motor power to [-100, 100].
- Works with PROS motor objects:
